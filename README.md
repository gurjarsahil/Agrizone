## 🌟 Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide accurate crop recommendations
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern, responsive design with intuitive navigation
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant crop recommendations based on input parameters
- **Detailed Insights**: Comprehensive information about recommended crops including:
  - Growing conditions
  - Soil requirements
  - Climate preferences
  - Water requirements
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Customizable theme for better user experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all devices
- **Interactive UI Elements**: Animated components and smooth transitions
- **Contact Form**: Easy communication channel for user queries

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gurjarsahil/Agrizone.git
cd Agrizone
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5500
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Navigate to the "Recommend" page
2. Enter the following soil and environmental parameters:
   - Nitrogen (N)
   - Phosphorus (P)
   - Potassium (K)
   - Temperature
   - Humidity
   - pH
   - Rainfall

3. Click "Get Recommendation" to receive crop suggestions
4. View detailed information about recommended crops including:
   - Growing conditions
   - Soil requirements
   - Climate preferences
   - Water requirements

## 📊 Model Details

The system uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on a comprehensive dataset of crop parameters. The model considers multiple factors to provide accurate recommendations:

- Soil composition (N, P, K levels)
- Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity)
- pH level
- Rainfall patterns
